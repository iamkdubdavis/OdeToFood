/*
A restaurant's overall rating can be calculated using various
methods.  For this application, we'll want to try different methods
over time, but for starters we'll allow an administrator to toggle
between two different techniques:

1. Simple mean of the "rating" value for the most recent n reviews
(the admin can configure the value n).

2. Weighted mean of the last n reviews.  The most recent n/2 reviews
will be weighted twice as much as the oldest n/2 reviews.

Overall rating should be a whole number.
